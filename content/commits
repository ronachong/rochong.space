-all files: removed "/" from all local resource paths (seemed to cause links,
 etc. to fail in Google Chrome)
-styles.css: specified height for header element; for some reason Chrome seems
 to computer everything in header to height ~47 px, not sure why, so did a
 manual hack for now.
-changed tagline ^.^
-removed identifying information in footer and changed small footer height to
 reflect 1 line instead of 2

notes:
-I notice that livepreview shows cover art for iframe icons, but not normal
 Chrome rendering. not sure why. might have to do with some javascript not
 working.
-manual hack is working variably for different pages, have to look into
 it. might be relative to what size the rest of the content is.
-file:///C:/Users/Kyle%20Chong/Desktop/Kusamochi/portfolio/11-14-2015.html
 stills seems to have broken css
-javascript doesn't seem to be working on
 file:///C:/Users/Kyle%20Chong/Desktop/Kusamochi/portfolio.html#nogo
-I think at some point I should compile all my css into one file; all my
 javascript & jquery into one file.
-I should actually include my fonts in my local resources and not import them
 (web performance reasons)
-I should include a web developer diary section where I can upload snippets and
 notes like this; as well as more broad musings on design and architecture.
-in the future I'd like my morgue to have snippets/snapshots of past iterations
 of website; maybe live previews of some sort as an advanced feature.
-I want a more raspberry color for the link styling. Is that too predictable?
-Could redo my current illustration in Illustrator to give it a feel closer to
 what I want. Would take like 10 hrs though.
-Current illustration may need to be positioned with absolute positioning or
 something similar to give it the position that I want. But I would like users
 to maybe be able to scroll past it (in which case this current flex layout
 doesn't even apply. - or I have to make a dynamic header - one big version, one
 small)
-thinking that I will not tweet directly from main account, but occasionally
 retweet @__kusamochi. Partly for branding purposes. But this means I will have
 to be a bit more careful about my writing and strike a fine balance by writing
 authentically but sometimes indirectly or obliquely.
-Need to add "past statuses" section to diary.
-Would like to swap out Disqus for more personal guestbook tool. could use PHP
 and forms :)

-"read at your own risk" for personal section. (if people read, they ought to
 hold themselves liable for acting like they don't know what they read!)
-introductory launch post; including "I decided to make this blog
 semi-anonymous. That means that if people really want to find me/find out who I
 am, they can. It also means that the amount of disclosure in my posts will
 change, and I'll have to strike a tough balance between..."

-tweets can serve as a platform to summarize (rephrase) & announce new content
 in a playful way.
-I would like readers/visitors to my blog to naturally get a sense/develop a
 sense of the "language" (by which I mean organization, by which I really mean,
 underlying logic) of my blog without me spelling it out for them. Like Chris
 Ware and Wliu's comments on Jimmy Corrigan.
-"Anyone can be a coder. Anyone can be an 'artist.'" Thinking about starting to
 evangelize people personalizing and creating their own web spaces in a highly
 personal, creative manner.
-Thinking of one day making a "look how far I've come! look how much I listened
 to you even though I didn't seem all that receptive!" thank you post to Penny
 Arcade. When I can feel like I'm actually decently committed to drawing comic
 style art.
-I've obviously just turned this developer log into a stream of consciousness
 thing. And my penchant for thinking and thinking up new things one after
 another is showing.
-I love hair! That's why I can draw it somewhat well (I like to think.)
-I love opacity (I mean transparency)! Just like I love glass.
-These are looking like tweets to me.

-Have to think about accessibility (colors but also other things)
-json dumps to link data (vs. using cms or database system like wordpress(?))

questions:
-why do file paths render as "file:///C:/"? I'm more used to seeing // or C:/
 only.

6/22/2016
-created a new github repo for kusamochi files and copied all files to repo
-initialized Capistrano library in github repo; configured deploy.rb,
 staging.rb, and production.rb
-used 'capistrano production deploy' to deploy code to server
-on server: changed kusamochi.com.conf file to specify root directory as
 current; restarted apache AND server to kick in changes

(prior to all of this: made custom nameserver rons, hosted on OVH server; made
zone file on rons specify IP for kusamochi.com as OVH server; changed nameserver
to rons on GoDaddy; created /home/admin/kusamochi and /var/www/ symlink to house
html for kusamochi; created kusamochi.com.conf file in apache/sites-available
and specified /var/www/kusamochi.com/public_html as root directory; enabled site
using sudo a2ensite; and restarted apache & server to kick in changes).

notes:
-cover images for preview icons now seem to work
-preview icon links are broken, probably has to do with absolute paths
